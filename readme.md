This project is an unofficial Windows CLI launcher for [Zed](https://zed.dev). It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Zed team.


### TODO:

- [x] Configurable `zed.exe` path
- [x] Path Launching: `zed .`
- [x] Just Running `zed` should just open zed with last project opened.
- [x] Open with Zed in context menu.
- [x] Not able to parse this `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Zed\zed.exe` path (mainly, due to not able to parse LOCALAPPDATA env)
- [ ] Better error handling/Message for end user
- [x] Strong Validation for ENV detection and executable path for configuration.
