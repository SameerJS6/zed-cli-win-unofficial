### TODO:

- [ ] Configurable `zed.exe` path
- [ ] Path Launching: `zed .`
- [ ] Just Running `zed` should just open zed with last project opened.
- [ ] Open with Zed in context menu.
- [ ] Not able to parse this `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Zed\zed.exe` path (mainly, due to not able to parse LOCALAPPDATA env)
- [ ] Better error handling/Message for end user
- [ ] Strong Validation for ENV detection and executable path for configuration.
